# Model Architecture Figures

This directory contains visualizations of the neural network architecture and model design.

## Expected Contents

- **Model architecture diagrams**: Complete network topology showing input, hidden layers, and output
- **Layer visualizations**: Detailed view of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers
- **Feature extraction pipeline**: Visual representation of how features are extracted from ultrasound images
- **Attention mechanisms**: If applicable, visualizations of attention weights
- **Transfer learning diagrams**: Showing pre-trained model components vs. fine-tuned layers

## Example Files
