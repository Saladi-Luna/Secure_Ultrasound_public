# Experimental Results

This directory contains performance metrics, training curves, and comparative results.

## Expected Contents

- **Training/validation curves**: Accuracy and loss over epochs
- **Comparative performance**: Bar charts comparing different models/approaches
- **Ablation studies**: Impact of different components
- **Class-specific performance**: Per-class accuracy metrics
- **Statistical significance**: Box plots, confidence intervals
